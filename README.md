# Hangman Game

A familiar childhood game to most of us whereby we will test our friends the word we have in mind.
Now, we can play this game through a telegram bot game!
Players can play the game either on our telegram bot: https://t.me/hangmanttbot?game=hangman17 or on computer: https://hangmangame17.herokuapp.com/

## How to play:
1. Click 'Go' button
2. Players will be given a random word in blanks. Just choose any letters from the in-game keypad.
   - letters used cannot be reused
3. If players guessed the wrong letter, 1 stroke will be drawn on the canvas.
4. Players lose if they guessed 8 wrong letters. Otherwise, they win!
